				    <h1> A to B </h1>
            <p> A new pathfinding method was designed and implemented, using self-generated weights and a wallhugging
            approach. The new pathfinding algorithm has gone through a number of tests to
            evaluate how well it performs compared against existing algorithms. With random maps
            generated for test variety, simulations were run over large map sizes ranging from 10x10 to
            100x100 to understand how the different approaches handled different situations.
            The test resultsshow that the new pathfinding algorithm is faster than existing methods such
            as A* to find a solution. A slightly longer path length is produced however.</p>
